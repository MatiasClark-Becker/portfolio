          Hi! I'm Matias Clark-Becker, an aspiring software engineer studying Computer Science at Carleton University within the AI and Machine Learning Stream. 
          I'm super interested in learning how machine learning can be applied to the game development industry and beyond! <br /><br />
          Outside of coding, I love to get outside and enjoy the surrounding natural beauty through hiking, cycling and gardening. 
          I'm also a passionate indie video game enthusiast, and I'm constantly exploring creative, new ideas for fun and innovative games!  <br /><br />
          Feel free to check out my projects below!
